What are the different types of shell and where are they used and how do we use them?
Ans : The C Shell - Arithmetic and C-like expression syntax
      The Bourne Shell - Faster, more preferred but lacks built-in arithmetic and logical expression handling(sun solaris)
      The Korn Shell - It has interactive features.It includes features like built-in arithmetic and C-like arras,functions and string-manipulation facilities.It is faster than C shell.
      GNU Bourne-Again Shell - Denoted as bas.It is compatible to the Bourne shell.It includes features from Korn and Bourne shell


What is the difference between login shell and non-login shell?
Ans : If the output is the name of our shell,prepended by a dash,then it is a login shell.For example : -bash,-su etc

How do we start login shell and non-login shell?
Ans : bash-l or sh-1

What happens when you start a login shell (which files are read and used and Why)
Ans : It looks for ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login,and ~/.

What happens when you start a non-login shell (Which files are read and used and Why)?
Ans : Bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc

What are Shell Configuration Files, why do we need it? 
Ans : /etc/profile : This is a "System wide" initialization file that is executed during login.This file provides initial environment variables and initial "PATH" locations
      /etc/bashrc : This again is a "System Wide" initialization file.This file is executed each time a Bash Shell is opened by a user.Here,you can define your default prompt and add alias information.Values in this file can be overridden by their local ~/.bashrc entry
      ~/.bash_profile : If this file exists, it is executed automatically after /etc/profile during the login process.This file can be used by each user to add individual entries.The file however is only executed once at login and normally then runs the users.bashrc file
      ~/.bash_login : If the ".bash_profile" does not exist,then this file will be executed automatically at login
      ~/.profile : If the ".bash_profile" or ".bash_login" donot exist,then this file is executed automatically at login
      ~/.bashrc : This file contains individual specific configurations.This file is read at login and also each time a new Bash shell is started.Ideally,this is where you should place any aliases.
      ~/.bash_logout : This file is executed automatically during logout
      ~/.inputrc : This file is used to customize key bindings/key strokes
      

What are Shell Variables, list major shell variables and what do they represent?
Ans : A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly.Some of these variables are environment variables whereas others are local variables. 

How we see all our env variables?
Ans : env

How we see all env variables in alphabical order?
Ans: env|sort

What Format does the env var and its values are stored? 
Ans : AUTOEXEC.BAT

How do you create your own varible?
Ans : Local var scope is limited to function in which he declared.It cant use outside function
      global var can be accessible in whole program/shell

How do you start a new bash shell?
Ans : bash

Difference between Local/Shell variables to Global Variable
Ans : Local variable is declared inside a function whereas Global variable is declared outside the function.


Making a variable accessible from other the shell in the system.
Ans : If you want to make a variable available to every new process,then you can put it in /etc/environment(requires root privileges)

Show the real life use case of exporting a variable
Ans : Export is bash shell BUILT-IN commands,which means it is part of the shell.It marks an environment variables to be exported to child-processes

Convert the above script file into a command, The file should run with "myappp" instead of "myapp.sh"

What is Globbing? Explain in depth with examples?
Ans : The Bash shell feature that is used for matching or expanding specific types of patterns is called globbing.Globbing is mainly used to match file names or searching for content in a file.Globbing uses wildcard characters to create the pattern.

List all entries with extension ".sh"
Ans : ls*.sh

List all entries with numbers in it.
Ans : ls +([0-9])

List all entries that starts with a character and ends with a number
Ans : ls |grep'^[A-Z]''[0-9]$'

List all entries that name length more than 5 characters
Ans : ls-A-d?????*

What is Quoting? and Why do we need it?
Ans : Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell.
      Quoting can be used to disable special treatment for special characters,to prevent reserved words from being recognized as such and to prevent parameter expansion

Write few(minimum 3) unique examples that shows, how a particular problem is solved using Quoting.
Ans : ~ Home directory 1
      ' Command substitution(archaic) 4
      # Comment 4
      $ Variable expression

How do you find a particular files/directories based on a particular search criteria?
HINT:- look for commands -> locate, find and whereis

Write major difference between locate, find and whereis?
Ans : Big difference is that find searches real files recursively down a given directoty.While, locate searches a database without requiring specific director.

How Globbing is different from locate, find and whereis?
Ans : The find program searches a directory tree to find a file or group of files.
      It traverses the directory tree and reports all occurences of a file matching and users specifications.
      The find program includes very powerful searching capability
      The locate program scans one or more databases of file names and displays any matches
      This can be used as a very fast find command if the file was present during the last file name databases update

Explain the Linux File System. 
Ans : A linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition
      A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data

Explain absolute and Relative Paths
Ans : Absolute path is defined as specifying the location of a file or directory from the root director(/).It remain same always
      Relative path is defined as the path related to the present working directl(pwd)

What are the different ways of creating a File in linux System? Write an example of each and the difference between them.
Ans: Touch : It help to create empty files.Eg : touch lohitha.txt creates empty text files
    Cat : Cat help to create files with some information.Eg : echo "my name is lohitha"
>lohitha.txt

In how many ways we can delete the files from linux system? write an example of each and teh difference between them.
Ans : rm : It directly delete files
      rm -i : It first confirm whether you want to delete file or not
      unlink file : you can delete file by unlink it

Archiving files using linux command, write a command to archive set of files from linux commands.
Ans: tar -cvf filename.tar
     we use '-f' for file name
     we use '-v' ("verbose") option to have tar output the names of files as they processed

Extract the archived files from the above step.
Ans : tar-xvf project.tar
we use -x for extract files
